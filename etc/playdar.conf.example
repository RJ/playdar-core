%%% Playdar configuration file.
%%%
%%% This configuration file contains Erlang terms.
%%% In case you want to understand the syntax, here are the concepts:
%%%
%%%  - The character to comment a line is %
%%%
%%%  - Each term ends in a dot, for example:
%%%      override_global.
%%%
%%%  - A tuple has a fixed definition, its elements are
%%%    enclosed in {}, and separated with commas:
%%%      {loglevel, 4}.
%%%
%%%  - A list can have as many elements as you want,
%%%    and is enclosed in [], for example:
%%%      [http_poll, web_admin, tls]
%%%
%%%  - A keyword (aka Erlang atom) is a word in lowercase.
%%%
%%%  - Strings are enclosed in "" and can have spaces, dots, etc.
%%%      {language, "en"}.
%%%      {name, "Joe"}.
%%%
%%%  - This term includes a tuple, a keyword, a list and two strings:
%%%      {dirs, ["/home/joe/music", "/mnt/music"]}.
%%%

%% Set a name, to be used on the LAN/etc:

%%{name, "Captain Kirk"}.

%% List of scripts to be started (resolver scripts)
%% You need quotes. You need a trailing comma, EXCEPT the last one in the list!

{scripts,[
    %"/path/to/a/resolver/script1.py",
    %"/path/to/a/resolver/script2.rb"
]}.
 
%% Settings for the Playdar webserver.
%%
%% If you don't listen on your LAN interface then you won't be able to serve
%% files to others on your LAN using the lan resolver.
%%
%% Playdar ignores any HTTP requests that don't originate from localhost, except
%% for requests to stream valid files (typically ones resolved by lan resolver).
%%
%% "0.0.0.0" means listen on all interfaces, and is recommended.
%% 

{web,[
    {port, 60210},
    {max, 100},
    {ip, "0.0.0.0"}, 
    {docroot, "priv/www"}
]}.

%% Set to true to serve up docroot/crossdomain.xml (defaults to true)

{crossdomain, true}.

%% List of module DIRECTORY NAMES that should not be loaded automatically:

{modules_blacklist, [
    "playdar-tcp"
]}.

%% Set to true for log output listing query results with scoring information

{explain, false}.
